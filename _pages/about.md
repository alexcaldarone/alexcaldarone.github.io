I'm a Statistics MSc student at EPFL. Previously, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Statistics for Technology and Science at the University of Padova and interned as an undergraduate researcher at the University of Warwick.

I am broadly interested in bayesian statistics, reinforcement learning and network data. Some courses I've enjoyed (or taking) are Statistical Inference, Measure Theory, Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, Causal Inference and Markov Chains.
